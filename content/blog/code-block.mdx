## Coolest Tool in Town

[`rehype-pretty-code`](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code) is a Rehype plugin powered by the
[`shiki`](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) syntax highlighter that provides beautiful code blocks for Markdown or MDX. It works on both the server at build-time (avoiding runtime syntax highlighting) and on the client for dynamic highlighting.

## Editor-Grade Highlighting

## Line Numbers and Line Highlighting

Draw attention to a particular line of code.

```js {4} showLineNumbers
import * from React

export default function Page() {
    console.log("Hello!")

    return (
        <p>
            Hello Everyone, I'm Salman
        </p>
    )
}
```
